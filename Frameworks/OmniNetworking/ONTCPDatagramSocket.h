// This class has the same semantics as ONUDPSocket or ONMulticastSocket, but can use any underlying socket as its transport mechanism.
// For example, you might initialize this with a non-blocking TCP socket and use this as a substitute for an ONMulticastSocket if you want to be able to have the same unreliable non-blocking semantics as a multicast or UDP socket (because you're doing a real-time server) but want a somewhat more reliable underlying transport mechanism (because your network connection is otherwise too lossy).
