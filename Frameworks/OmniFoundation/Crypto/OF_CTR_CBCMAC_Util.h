/* Helpers for the CBC-MAC format described for CCM in RFC3610.
 *
 * ccmProcessHeaderBlocks() must be called first to process the nonce, header, and AAD.
 * ccmProcessMessage() may be called zero or more times afterwards. All but the last call *must* be an integer number of blocks, and the total byteCount must be exactly equal to the byte count passed to ccmProcessHeaderBlocks().
 *
 * The buffer pointed to by outLastBlock will contain the last block of CBC output after each call and can be used to compute the authentication tag.
 *
 * ccmCreateCTRCryptor() creates a CCCryptorRef in CTR mode with the appropriately formatted IV block.
