/* It's often more convenient to represent these as a few integers than as CFTypeRefs.

We could use the convenient CSSM_ALGID_RSA etc. constants directly, but I worry that Apple will decide to deprecate those. For now, rename the ones we use. This enum also makes it clear that we're collapsing related algorithms into one, since all we want to represent is the kind of key, not a specific algorithm. */
