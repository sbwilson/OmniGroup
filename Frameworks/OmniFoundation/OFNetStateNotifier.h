/*
 Allows processes on the same network to communitate small state changes. For example, process that synchronize documents can publish a state change when they've been edited and new changes are available for other processes on the network to synchronize.
 
 Each instance can participate in multiple groups, so typically only one instance of this class would exist and it would be configured by the application to listen to different groups as needed. By default no groups are listened to (and so no notifications will be posted).
