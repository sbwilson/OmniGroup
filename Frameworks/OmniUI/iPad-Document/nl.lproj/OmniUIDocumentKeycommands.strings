/*
 This file is used to map generic strings representing key commands to their description for use with -[UIKeyCommand discoverabilityTitle].
 
 The conventions to uphold are as follows:
 
 - Filename â€” Use the name of the keycommands file appending "Keycommands" and an extension of .strings (e.g. `Foo.keycommands` key command discoverability titles live in `FooKeycommands.strings`
 
 - Key identifier is the name of the selector that key command will call with any trailing method signature syntax striped (e.g. @selector(foo:) becomes "foo")
 
 // TODO: Would need to extend OUIKeyCommands implementation and keycommands files to include and extract an identifier if we need to use the same selector with a different discoverability title based on category.
