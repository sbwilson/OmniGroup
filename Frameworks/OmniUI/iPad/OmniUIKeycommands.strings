/*
 This file is used to map discoverability identifiers representing key commands to their description for use with -[UIKeyCommand discoverabilityTitle].
 
 The conventions to uphold are as follows:
 
 - Filename â€” Use the name of the keycommands file appending "Keycommands" and an extension of .strings (e.g. `Foo.keycommands` key command discoverability titles live in `FooKeycommands.strings`
 
 - Discoverability title identifier is configured in Foo.keycommands. If a discoverability title is desired for the key command, it should have an entry here.
 */

// Currently no discoverability titles for OmniUI.keycommmands.
