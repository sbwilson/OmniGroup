/*! Reads values from a plist in a bundle and converts those values into usable constants for implementing user interfaces. +appearance searches in the bundle of the receiver for a plist with a name derived from that of the receiver. (See +appearance for details.)
 *
 * Subclasses can inherit and override appearance attributes from their superclass. If an appearance object is asked for a value that is not in its plist, it will consult its superclass. Thus, it is recommended that each application or framework create a subclass of OAAppearance and use it consitently.
 *
 * OAAppearance will dynamically generate accessors for any declared properties. To use this feature, declare a _readonly_ property of the appropriate type in a category on your OAAppearance subclass. (Declaring the property in a category helps avoid accidental automatic property synthesis.)
 *
 * Then, provide a `dynamic` declaration in your category implementation. At runtime, OAAppearance will use the property's name (which may differ from the property's getter name) as a key path to the appropriate primitive accessor (such as -colorForKeyPath:).
