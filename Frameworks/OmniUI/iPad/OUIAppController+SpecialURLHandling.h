 Provide another type of special URL command for handling and invocation. Calling this method maps the path in a special URL (e.g. the "/debug" in "omnifocus:///debug?...") to a strategy for invoking that URL on an application, encapsulated inside a command class (e.g. the OmniFocus class DebugURLAlertCommand).
 
 @param cls The class to use when invoking a special URL containing the given path. Must be a subclass of OUISpecialURLCommand.
 @param specialURLPath The path component of special URLs that can be invoked using the given class. Must include the leading forward slash â€“ provide @"/debug", not @"debug".

 Confirm and invoke the given special URL using a command class earlier registered with OUIAppController. This method prompts the user to confirm that they meant to enter the given URL and perform its associated action, then runs that action against the current application.

/*!
 Abstract class providing an interface for invoking commands on behalf of a special URL. Applications can subclass OUISpecialURLCommand to handle specific command types, such as running a debug command or changing an app-specific setting.
 
 Each subclass must be capable of handling any URL with a certain path; a hypothetical debug command class, for example, would need to handle any URL with the path "/debug". After subclassing, applications should register their classes and associated paths with OUIAppController using +registerCommandClass:forSpecialURLPath:.
